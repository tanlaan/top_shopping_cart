# Chris Bolas' Shopping Cart Project

## Back Story

### The Odin Project Link
You can find the specifications for the project [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/shopping-chart).

### React Router
We have just learned the very minimal basics of the React Router library and were sent head long to make a functional look alike to a shopping cart web page. The MVP of this should be relatively quick to produce. My plan is to make the functional ugly version and when I get to a point of re-learning CSS to go through all of this first time projects and make them look spiffy.
